"""Main and single module of GGCG. This library generates computational graphs and trains them using genetic generation
algorithms. This module has 3 main packages:

- Core (core): Contains the components of the computational graphs and the logic to build and compute them.
- Generator (gen): Contains the logic to simplify, modify and regenerate new graphs based on existing ones.
- Trainer (trn): Contains methods to train a computational graph to model a given set of data."""
